Don't downgrade your dream just to fit your reality, upgrade your conviction to match your destiny
You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem and smarter than you think
You are confined only by the walls you build yourself
The man who has confidence in himself gains the confidence of others
It's not who you are that holds you behind, it's who you think your are not
Stop being afraid of what could go wrong and think of what could go right
Falling down is an accident, staying down is a choice
Always believe that something wonderful is about to happen
Don't be afraid to give up the good and go for great
Remember that life's greatest lessons are usually learned from worst times and from the worst mistakes
Never stop doing great just because someone doesn't give you credit
Discipline is doing what needs to be done, even if you don't want to
The key to success is to focus our conscious mind on things we desire, not things we fear
Never apologize for having high standards, people who really want to be in your life will rise to meet them
If it doesn't challenge you, it won't change you
Never give up on a dream just because of the time it will take to accomplish it, time will pass anyway
Don't fear failure Fear being in the exact same place next year as you are today
A hill is just another opportunity to leave your competition behind
Hustle until you no longer need to introduce yourself
You didn't come this far only to come this far
Be selective in your battles for sometimes peace is better than being right
If we keep doing what we are doing, we're going to keep getting what we're getting
You will never know your limits until you push yourself to them
Do what you have to do until you can do what you want to do
The man on top of the mountain didn't fall there
